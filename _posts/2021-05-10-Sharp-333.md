in few years many pepole ask me why i'm alyaws put on dark shirt and i don't know how to ask this question when ask this question i'm always say because i like it but 


black or dark color for me is everthing about mind or thinking about my favrioute title such as : space - sky - sometimes in movie and serial or coding - reading book - travel to cold and rainy place and and other things 

when i write this post i think this post very smiliar to **the Nights** music from **Tim Bergling** if dont listing to this song definitely listen it

and last but not least everyone has work with css knows  about sharp 333 = #333 it mean my favrioute color **dark** {color:#333;}
