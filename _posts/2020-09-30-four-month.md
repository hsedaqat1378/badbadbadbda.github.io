Hi, the fourth month of learning programming has passed for me during this period, and based on the knowledge I have of myself, I realized that I can do things that I had never imagined before, at least now I can say that I have changed a lot in this one year. Although it was very difficult for me at the beginning, but little by little, it made me patient and, most importantly, find a solution to my problems. I realized that I had to make a plan to achieve my long-term goals and I had to wait for a year. I know him so that I can be a better person
On the occasion of the fourth month
