My first post is about my favorite song Which always motivates forward in all situations/// love imagine dragons band üëçüôå‚ù§

My favorite part of this song :

 And I know it's hard when you're falling down
 And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
 Get up now, get up, get up now
 And I know it's hard when you're falling down
 And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
 Get up now, get up, get up now
' Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
 I'm on top of the world, 'ey
 Waiting on this for a while now
 Paying my dues to the dirt
 I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
 Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
 Take it with me if I can
 Been dreaming of this since a child
 I'm on top of the world
